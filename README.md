#mass-experimental

Stuff that isn't ready to go into the main mass repository yet, and may not be for a while.

The idea of this repository is to reduce the amount of half written things that have become low priority in the main mass repository. To install this repository, first install [mass](http://github.com/ksandom/mass). Then run `manageMass addExperimental` .
