# DoneIt - Plate

For tracking what tasks are on your plate at the moment regardless of what you've been working on today.

```
$ doneit --plate
(project)  active  0  normal  doneItAdd (Additional features to doneIt.)  -  3.9 days
  Currently working on plate.
(project)  finished  6  wow  test6 (Another test)  -  3.9 days
  Hopefully my last major test.
(project)  finished  0  normal  test7 (Another test 7)  -  3.9 days
  Hopefully my last major test 7.
```

## Getting started

You probably want to `--setPlateDefaults` so that state, priority, and how note-worthy the task is are set at sensible values when you add something to the plate. See `doneit --help=--setPlateDefaults` for more information.
