# Quick start

## The features you'll use most often.

Use `mass --help=--feature` for any of the features below to find out everything about these features.

* `--tasks` Lists out the current possible tasks you can do. You can add more using `--addTask`.
* `--doing` Says what you are doing now.
* `--dbg` (or `--dayBeGone`) is the same as doing `--doing=bp`, which means "personal break". Ie not working.

* `--today` and `--yesterday` list what you have done today and yesterday, respectively.
* `--done` lists everything you have ever done. Combining this with `--refine` gives you the ability to do some really interesting analysis on where your time is going.
* `--tsDay`, `--tsWeek` are an effective way of choosing a specific set of results.
* `--amend` changes the current thing you're doing and takes the same parameters as `--doing`

## Example

    mass --doing=misc,,"Showing off DoneIt"
    mass --today
    
    TODO fill in this output
    
    mass --doing=bp
    
    TODO fill in this output
